# E-yantra-2k17
E yantra

This repository contains my work throughout the E-yantra 2k17 competition.
The repository has all the codes and issues being faced by me while trying to accomplish my task.
The technologies I have worked on in this competition were Raspberry Pi-3, Python, OpenCV and Optical Encoder Motors.
